    <p align="justify">Development Initiative for Social Advancement, known as DISA initiated Technical Training Institute in December 2012 with a view to empowering technical skill in several fields of technology to the adolescent’s boys & girls of DISA’s program participants and other community members in DISA’s working areas. At the beginning its activities started from Borkoit, Chandina, Comilla. Later, the institute has two campuses one in Dhaka & another in Borkoit, Comilla. DTTI, Dhaka campus has been shifted in March 2017 to a new eight storied building at Safura Tower, plot# 45, Road# 07, Block# A, Pallobi, Mirpur-12. 
In DTTI, Dhaka as per the need of our country as well as overseas requirement several new technology based one year long and short training facilities have been incorporated. From 01/01/2018 first batch of one year long technical training courses in 4 (four) different trades namely, 1) Computer, 2) Electrical, 3) Refrigeration and Air Conditioning & 4) Motor Cycle repair and servicing has begun. Regarding best utilization of DTTI facilities, management has decided to remain open for all from all over the country who are interested in skill building technical education. 

For conducting updated technical training, education and higher professional courses as well as to produce professionally qualified and skilled manpower in our country DISA management has taken the challenge to establish a professional technical training and higher education institute primarily in the DTTI campus, Mirpur-12 in later part of 2017. The name of the institute has chosen as “DISA Institute of Science and Technology (DIST)”. Since 2017 DISA Technical Training Institutes (DTTI) Borkoit, Comilla run under the guidance and control of DIST. 

Both DIST, Dhaka and DTTI, Borkoit, Comilla are well equipped with trade based necessary machineries & equipment. DIST and DTTI can be considered a social enterprise as its earnings will be fully utilized for improving the institute itself. One of the major specialty of DIST is to provide. Education Loan for the deserving adolescent boys and girls. Qualified and well experienced trainers and expert management set up has already been engaged there for running the training institute smoothly. The Management Team of DIST is responsible for implementation of all the decisions taken by the Board of Trustees and controlling the activities of DIST and DTTI. Till now, trainees who have successfully completed the DIST and DTTI technical courses, almost all of them have already been employed by various relevant organizations/agencies and some of them are self-employed.
